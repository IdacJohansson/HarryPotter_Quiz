# Harry Potter character quiz

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a simple, interactive game using all of the tools that we have worked with troughout this course (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React). The game will include a login system, allowing users to create accounts. Account details will be stored locally on the user’s computer. Additionally, the project will incorporate fetching data from an external API, enhancing the game with dynamic content.

## Key Features:

### User Authentication:
A login screen where users can:
Create an account by entering a username and password.
Log in with existing credentials.
Account data will be stored locally using localStorage or another browser-based storage method.

### Game Interface:
A simple and engaging game designed using React’s component-based architecture.
Interactive elements with user feedback.

### API Integration:
Use of an external API to fetch and display data related to the game.
Dynamic updates in the game based on API responses (e.g., fetching scores, game-related data, or additional challenges).

### Responsive Design:
A user-friendly interface that works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

### State Management:
Manage game state and user data effectively using React's state management (e.g., useState, useContext, ).
